       <BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0001]  1. Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>[0002]  This invention relates to a hermetically sealed three-dimensional
     electrode device and a method of manufacturing such a device. The device
     may be particularly useful for neuron interface and more specifically as
     a cortical implant.
<BR><BR>[0003]  2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed
     Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98
<BR><BR>[0004]  A nerve is a cordlike structure which is composed of numerous
     nerve fibers conveying impulses between a part of the central nervous
     system and some other region of the body. A nerve is made up of
     individual nerve fibers with their sheaths and supporting cells, small
     blood vessels, and a surrounding connective tissue sheath. Each nerve
     fiber is surrounded by a cellular sheath (neurilemma) from which it may
     or may not be separated by a laminated lipo-protein layer (myelin
     sheath). A group of such nerve fibers surrounded by a sheet of connective
     tissue (perineurium) is called a fasciculus. The fasciculi are then bound
     together by a thick layer of connective tissue (epineurium) to form the
     nerve.
<BR><BR>[0005]  Neurologists have long sought an electrode device which could
     establish stable electrical contact with a large number of individual
     nerve fibers within a nerve or a large number of individual neurons. Such
     a device would find wide medical application for sensing neurological
     impulses, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of such impulses,
     and delivering electrical stimuli to target nerve fibers as a reaction to
     such analysis or as a result of external input. The ideal electrode
     device would be adapted to the anatomy of the nerve so that it could
     penetrate the nerve in a nondestructive fashion in order to form focused
     electrical contacts with a very large number of individual nerve fibers.
<BR><BR>[0006]  Nerve cuff electrodes are employed in the neurological sciences
     for sensing nervous impulses and for electrically stimulating nerves. The
     nerve cuff electrode encircles the entire nerve and senses gross nervous
     impulses arising from the nerve fibers within the nerve. The nerve cuff
     electrode may also be employed to electrically stimulate the nerve.
     Individual nerve fibers within a nerve may be functionally distinct from
     the other nerve fibers. The utility of the nerve cuff electrode is
     limited by its inability to specifically direct signals to or from
     selected nerve fibers within the nerve.
<BR><BR>[0007]  In order to make electrical contact with individual nerve fibers
     within a nerve, narrow gauge needle electrodes may be employed. When a
     narrow gauge needle is inserted into the nerve, there is a chance that it
     may make electrical contact with an individual nerve fiber or a small
     number of such fibers. If electrical contact is desired with each of
     several nerve fibers, then several needle electrodes must be employed.
     However, the technique of using multiple needle electrodes becomes
     progressively more and more difficult as the number of electrodes
     increases. Hence, there is a limit to the number of needle electrodes
     which can be usefully employed on a single nerve. Also, the electrical
     contact between a needle electrode and its corresponding nerve fiber can
     be disrupted by muscle motion and other forms of motion, since the end of
     the needle opposite the electrode extends outside the nerve and can be
     levered by relative motion of neighboring tissues. Therefore, long term
     implantation of needle electrodes with stable electrical contact with
     nerve fibers is not possible with prior art needle electrodes.
<BR><BR>[0008]  An electrode array having several electrodes integrated into one
     device is disclosed by Robert L. White. (Proc. First International
     Conference on Electrical Stimulation of the Acoustic Nerve as a Treatment
     for Profound Sensorineural Deafness in Man, pub. by Velo-Bind, Inc.
     (1974), ed. by Michael M. Merzenich, et al., entitled "Integrated
     Circuits and Multiple Electrode Arrays," pp 199-207, by Robert L. White).
     White's electrode array employs a prong shaped base fabricated from a
     silicon wafer. The silicon base supports an array of electrodes which are
     deposited thereon toward the end of the prong. Each of the electrodes is
     small, flat, and circular, about 50 micrometers in diameter. Each
     electrode is connected to a corresponding conductor which carries signals
     to and from the electrode. The conductor is electrically insulated from
     the tissue by a layer of silicon dioxide. In use, the prong is inserted
     tip first into neural tissue. Neural tissue is displaced by the prong as
     it is inserted. Substantial damage to neural tissue can result from the
     insertion process due to the relatively large bulk of the prong. Since
     neural tissue slides tangentially past the electrodes during the
     insertion process, the flatness of the electrodes helps to minimize the
     resultant disruption and destruction of neural tissue. Once the device is
     inserted, the flatness of the electrodes limits the contact between the
     electrode and the neural tissue. Flat electrodes can make electrical
     contact only with neural tissue which is directly adjacent to the surface
     of the prong.
<BR><BR>[0009]  Multiple electrode devices with microelectrode tips protruding
     beyond and in a plane parallel to a silicon carrier (i.e. planar
     electrodes) are disclosed by Wise, et al. (IEEE Transactions on
     Biomedical Engineering, vol. BME-17(3), pp 238-247, July 1970, "An
     Integrated Circuit Approach to Extracellular Microelectrodes," and vol.
     BME-22(3), May 1975, "A Low-Capacitance Multielectrode Probe for Use in
     Extracellular Neurophysiology") and by Ko (IEEE Transactions on
     Biomedical Engineering, vol. BME-33, pp 153-162, February 1986, "Solid
     State Physical Transducers for Biomedical Research"). Wise teaches that
     the lateral spacing and length of the protruding tips may be controlled
     to produce various planar electrode arrays. Like the White device, the
     silicon carrier of the Wise and Ko devices have the shape of a prong and
     may cause significant tissue damage to the nerve during the insertion
     process. Also, if the Wise and Ko prong-shaped devices are implanted,
     their large bulk compromises the stability of the electrical contact
     between the electrode tips and individual target cells. Additionally, the
     thinness of the prong can make it susceptible to shear damage with side
     loading. Further, since the silicon carrier and the electrode tips are
     essentially coplanar with the tips cantilevered freely beyond the end of
     the carrier, the carrier imparts little if any transverse stability to
     the fragile tips during insertion of the Wise, et al. and Ko prong-shaped
     devices or after their implantation. Moreover, the number of useful
     electrodes which may be incorporated into the Wise and Ko devices is
     inherently limited. Since the electrode tips are aligned in a row along
     the edge of the silicon carrier, it is not possible to array the
     electrodes into a configuration with more than one dimension.
<BR><BR>[0010]  Known "bed of nails" devices are disclosed by Byers, et al. in
     U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,837,049 and 4,969,468 and by Normann, et al. in U.S.
     Pat. No. 5,215,088, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
     These inventions relate to electrodes for electrically sensing or
     stimulating living tissues. In particular, the invention relates to
     electrode arrays and to methods for making and using such arrays. The
     tips of the needles may be left exposed by a dielectric coating. Below
     the needle is a metallic layer upon which the conductors are formed. The
     dielectric may be silicon dioxide. However, these devices are difficult
     to seal "hermetically", as is required when they are part of a "smart"
     array containing electronic signal processing means.
<BR><BR>[0011]  The needles may be constructed as "cones" and a method of
     construction may use techniques similar to those taught in U.S. Pat. Nos.
     3,755,704, 3,789,471, and 3,812,559, each naming Charles A. Spindt, et
     al. as inventors U.S. Pat. No. 3,453,478, naming Kenneth R Soulders and
     Louis N. Heynick as inventors, also discloses background technology for
     constructing cones. Further disclosure on known fabrication technology

<BR><BR>[0012]  Evaporating metal to form the needles of platinum, activated
     iridium, platinum-iridium alloy, rhenium, or other suitable implantable
     electrode material is presented.
<BR><BR>[0013]  Thus, what is missing and what is needed by practicing
     neurologists is an implantable electrode device which can electrically
     contact a large number of individual cells within an organ or tissue for
     sensing and/or controlling various bodily functions. The individual
     contacts should each be focused within a small region so that they
     involve single cells. However, the range of the contacts should extend
     over a relatively large region within the organ or tissue. The electrodes
     of the device should make positive contact with target cells, be firmly
     anchored, and should be stable over long periods of time, even with
     recurrent movement in adjacent tissues. On the other hand, the device
     should penetrate the target organ without being intrusive so that tissue
     damage to the target organ is minimal. The device should have a small
     volume and a robust construction for practical medical applications.
<BR><BR>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0014]  The electrode array of the present invention is a device for
     establishing stable electrical contact with living tissue. In the
     preferred embodiment, the electrode array has a configuration for making
     multiple extracellular contacts and for conducting electrical signals to
     or from each cell with which there is contact. However, the electrode
     array can also be employed for measuring the voltage potential of the
     surface of organs and tissues, e.g. for EKG or EEG.
<BR><BR>[0015]  The electrode array includes a base of semiconducting or
     nonconducting material having a support surface, an array of conducting
     electrodes which extend substantially perpendicular to and from the
     support surface of the base and serve as electrodes and conductors
     incorporated onto or in the base and connected to the electrodes for
     carrying electrical signals to and/or from such electrodes. The invention
     also includes various embodiments of the electrode array and methods for
     using and fabricating such electrode arrays.
<BR><BR>[0016]  In a preferred embodiment of the electrode array, the electrodes
     are coated with an insulating layer of dielectric material, except for an
     uncoated area, such as a revealed band or a hole though the needle. This
     feature narrows and focuses the contact area of each electrode to a
     relatively small region and facilitates the ability of the electrode to
     contact single cells or small groups of cells.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0034]  The invention, FIG. 1, is an electrode array 6, also known as a
     "bed-of-nails", which is applied to living tissue to provide an effective
     electrical connection therewith, whether for sensing or stimulating
     purposes. The electrode array 6 provides a multiple possibility of
     successful electrical contact, and causes minimal damage or upset to
     either the living tissue or to the body system. The electrode array 6
     includes an arrangement of electrically conductive needles that arise
     from a substrate 14, are substantially normal thereto, and which serve as
     electrodes 4 (FIG. 2) for sensing or stimulation of living tissue.
     Terminals and electrical conductors may be employed to connect individual
     electrodes 4 or groups of electrodes of the electrode array 6 to other
     electrical circuits.
<BR><BR>[0035]  The bed-of-nails package 2 consists of the electrodes 4, which
     form an array 6 that may be in a planar, square or rectangular
     arrangement having regular spacing intervals, as depicted in the various
     embodiments presented in FIGS. 1 to 9 and 13 to 16, or which may be in an
     irregular or non-repetitive arrangement such as may be dictated by the
     desired function of the package 2. While the package 2 is presented as a
     generally rectangular package having rounded edges and corners, it may
     advantageously have a flat circular or ovaloid shape or other shape
     without limitation to those shapes just disclosed. The package 2 may have
     a thickness of about 2 mm, plus the length of the electrodes. In a
     preferred embodiment, the electrode 4 is about 0.5 to 4.0 mm (0.02 to
     0.16 inches) in length and about 0.02 to 0.10 mm (0.001 to 0.004 inches)
     in diameter. Aspect ratios (height to diameter) of 40:1 are readily
     achievable. In the embodiment presented, the electrode array 6 contains
     about 121 electrodes 4 in a square matrix. The electrodes 4 may, of
     course, be taller and narrower. Electrode spacing in the array may vary,
     as may the size of the needles. Of course, such electrodes 4 may be
     conical or other elongated shapes. The spacing of the electrodes 4,
     transversely across a nerve, would be from approximately 0.5 micrometer
     to on the order of 100 micrometers. "On the order of" means within the
     range of 0.1 to 10 times the dimension, in this context and as used
     herein. Spacing of the electrodes 4 along the length of a nerve might
     well be greater than the lateral spacing of the electrodes 4 across the
     nerve. That is, the spacing distance between electrodes 4 along the
     length of a nerve can vary a great deal. Electrodes 4 or electrode array
     6 might well be longitudinally spaced 1,000 micrometers, 2,000
     micrometers, etc., from one another, depending on the desired density of
     electrical contact with the nerve. The package 2 may be planar or may be
     alternately shaped to conform to a specific desired application, although
     only planar arrays are presented in FIGS. 1 to 9 and 13 to 16. The
     electrode 4 material is biocompatible and is not limited to but may be
     selected from titanium, titanium alloy, platinum, platinum alloy,
     activated iridium, platinum-iridium alloy, conductive polymer, carbon or
     other suitable electrically conductive material known by those skilled in
     the art as suitable for use in connection with the body. In general,
     metals or other conductive substances which are inert and are least
     subject to corrosion are selected. In the case of stimulating devices,
     conductive materials which can handle the necessary current densities are
     required. In a preferred embodiment, the electrodes 4 are comprised of an
     electrically conductive and biocompatible material which may be elemental
     metals or alloys, such as but not limited to a titanium alloy, such as
     Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-5Al-2.5Fe, Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo, Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn, or
     Ti-4Al-4Mo-2Sn--Si, or a platinum alloy, such as 90Pt-10Ir or 80Pt-20Ir,
     or pure platinum, or pure iridium. As will be discussed herein, coatings
     may be employed to enhance the stability of the electrodes 4. Candidate
     coating materials include, but are not limited to, gold, platinum,
     iridium, platinum oxide or iridium oxide, or another coating that is
     suitable for electrode application. The coating is applied to the
     electrode 4 surface at least where the electrode 4 is exposed to living
     tissue, as it is at a reveal 72 or at an uncoated through-hole 76.
<BR><BR>[0036]  The electrodes 4 must, therefore, be spaced according to the
     specific application. The electrodes 4 should be small and of the correct
     sharpness to avoid damaging the nerve. Also the electrically conductive
     portion of each electrode 4 should be small enough to contact only a
     single fiber and thereby obtain signals from only one fiber.
     Consequently, a preferred embodiment of the invention is to insulate the
     electrode, except at selected location or locations between a distal end
     80 and a proximal end 82 of the electrode 4, so that at least one
     electrically conductive portion of each electrode 4 is exposed. In this
     way, each electrode 4 may be designed to contact the living tissue at one
     location or at multiple locations, if more than one electrically
     conductive portion of the electrode 4 is exposed to effect electrical
     contact more than one fiber of living tissue.
<BR><BR>[0037]  In addition, the electrodes 4 must be high or long enough to
     assure sufficient penetration of the desired nerve so as to make
     electrical connection with the nerve fiber inside the nerve. In order to
     reach the nerve fiber, the sheath and other connective tissues must be
     penetrated. However, "electrical connection" or "contact" with a nerve
     fiber or other body tissue may mean actual physical contact with the
     nerve fiber or tissue or it may mean being in sufficiently close location
     to sense the electrical signals therefrom or to stimulate the fiber or
     tissue.
<BR><BR>[0038]  The electrode 4 spacing and length may vary on a given substrate
     14. In order to reach down into a fissure in the brain, for example, it
     may be desirable to have longer electrodes 4 on one portion of the
     electrode array 6 and shorter electrodes 4 on another portion. Also,
     spacing density on one portion of the electrode array 6 may be greater or
     lesser than on another portion. The term "electrode array" as used herein
     means a collection of electrodes and includes systematic and orderly
     groupings or arrangements as well as including non-linear and irregular
     groupings or arrangements, which may be dictated by the function to be
     served by the electrode array. There may be an abrupt change of electrode
     4 length or density, or both, in one or more directions. There may be
     graded or gradual changes in one or more directions.
<BR><BR>[0039]  It is to be understood that the array 6 may be sized to fit the
     particular application and may be planar, multiplanar, curved, twisted,
     or other desired shape as required in the particular circumstances
     involved. Ordinarily, the electrode array 6 is disposed on a rigid
     substrate 14. However, it is to be appreciated that the substrate 14 may
     be flexible, or that the electrode array 6 may be comprised of electrodes
     4 on a plurality of substrates 14. In general, the electrodes 4 in an
     array 6 should be held in relatively fixed spacing with respect to each
     other. It is intended to cover by "relatively fixed" terminology,
     instances in which the substrate 14 is flexible, curved, stretchable,
     etc.
<BR><BR>[0040]  Among the suitable substrates 14 are, without limitation,
     ceramics, such as zirconia, more specifically stabilized-zirconia,
     partially-stabilized zirconia, tetragonal zirconia polycrystal,
     magnesia-stabilized zirconia, ceria-stabilized zirconia,
     yttria-stabilized zirconia, and calcia-stabilized zirconia, as well as
     silicon, sapphire, alumina, or germanium. Biomedical grade plastics may
     also be used such as the polyamides, polyimides, polymethacrylates,
     acrylics, polycarbonates, etc., to the extent that such plastics may be
     implantable or rendered implantable. These plastics cannot form a braze
     bond and, more importantly, they do not form a hermetic device.
<BR><BR>[0041]  The electrodes 4 may be arranged in random fashion or ordered in
     columns and/or rows or other ordered arrangements. The optimum embodiment
     from the standpoint of orderly electrical connection is an ordered
     arrangement. One embodiment which may be desired is that in which each
     electrode 4 (except, of course, those near the edges of the array 6) is
     surrounded by six other electrodes 4, all equidistantly spaced. The
     electrodes 4 are electrically connected to a terminal which may,
     likewise, be randomly located or located in orderly columns and/or rows.
     The terminal may include bonding pads which provide an electrical
     connection between the electrodes 4 and other electrical circuits.
     Connection points need not be in the same arrangement as the electrodes
     4. Thus, the electrodes 4 may be located in columns, but not rows, and
     the terminals may be located in columns and rows.
<BR><BR>[0042]  In addition, the package 2 is comprised of a case 12 that may have
     two halves, as illustrated in FIG. 1. The two halves of case 12 are
     welded together at weld 36 to form a hermetic seal. The case is comprised
     of biocompatible materials, which in a preferred embodiment may be
     titanium or an alloy of titanium that is weldable.
<BR><BR>[0043]  Cable 8 transmits electrical signals to and/or from the package 2
     and is electrically connected to the electrodes 4 in a manner to assure
     that the desired function of the device is achieved. Header 10
     electrically isolates the connections between the cable 8 and the
     electrodes 4. The isolation formed by the header 10 is not necessarily
     hermetic and may therefore be accomplished by forming header 10 of an
     epoxy material or a biocompatible electrically insulating material, which
     need not form a hermetic seal in the instant application, but which
     provide electrical isolation between the feedthrough pins 34. In a
     preferred application, the number of electrical conductors in cable 8
     approximate the number of feedthrough pins 34.
<BR><BR>[0044]  A cross-section of the device 2 is presented (FIG. 2) showing the
     electrodes 4 in a flat, rectangular electrode array 6, where each
     electrode 4 is hermetically bonded to substrate 14. Electronic components
     18 are presented and consist of integrated circuit chips, capacitors, and
     other electronic components that are known to those skilled in the art.
     Inclusion of signal processing as part of the device enables a "smart"
     array, wherein it is necessary to have hermetic and biocompatible
     packaging for the bed of nails and electronics. The case 12 covers and
     encloses electronic components 18 and forms a hermetic seal with
     substrate 14 by, for example, a braze joint 86. Feedthrough pins 34 are
     shown in a preferred embodiment as flat headed pins that are comprised of
     a conductive brazeable metal, such as titanium or its alloys, niobium or
     its alloys, platinum or its alloys, iridium or its alloys, or silver or
     its alloys. The feedthrough pins 34 are bonded by known processes, such
     as brazing or welding, to the electrical conductors in cable 8.
<BR><BR>[0045]  The embodiment of device 2 presented in FIG. 2 presents a
     preferred embodiment where a lid 84 is comprised of a material such as
     those candidates presented for substrate 14, notably zirconia or alumina.
     The lid 84 is attached by braze joint 88 to case 12, thereby forming a
     hermetic seal that protects electronics components 18. In alternate
     embodiments lid 84 may be comprised of a metal and may be comprised of
     the same material as case 12, potentially being an integral part of the
     assembly and thus avoiding joint 88.
<BR><BR>[0046]  A sub-assembly to aid in describing the assembly process is
     presented in FIG. 3. In this embodiment the electrodes 4, while forming
     an electrode array 6, are inserted into a conforming braze preform 16,
     which is comprised of a braze material, from the top surface 124 of
     substrate 14. Substrate 14 receives a portion of each electrode 4 prior
     to being thermally processed to develop a hermetic seal between each
     electrode 4 and the substrate 14.
<BR><BR>[0047]  The substrate 14, FIG. 4, contains a number of feedthrough holes
     20 which correspond to the number and configuration of electrodes 4 when
     they are arranged in the electrode array 6. The electrode 4, as presented
     in FIG. 5, consists of a shaft 22 which has a sharp end at its distal end
     80, for tissue penetration during use, and an end that contacts brazing
     head 24 at its proximal end 82. The electrode then terminates with
     feedthrough 26 which, in the embodiment presented in FIG. 5, enters
     feedthrough hole 20 from the top surface 124 until brazing head 24
     contacts braze preform 16, which in turn contacts substrate 14. A
     feedthrough 26 is comprised of a hole 20, braze joint 74, and electrode.
     Substrate 14 is preferably comprised of a ceramic, preferably zirconia.
<BR><BR>[0048]  Braze preform 16 is presented in FIG. 6 and is configured to have
     a hole 32 that corresponds to each substrate feedthrough hole 20, which
     in turn corresponds in approximate diameter and location to the electrode
     4 and electrode array 6. The braze material of braze preform 16 forms a
     plurality of tabs 30 thereby forming a matrix of braze material as a
     layer or multiple layers of braze material which, when thermally
     processed, hermetically bonds the electrodes 4 to the substrate 14. A
     large non-functional opening or void 28 is formed by the interconnecting
     tabs 30 and holes 32. The tabs 30 may be removed after brazing by
     sandblasting, dicing, laser ablation, etc. so that individual electrodes
     are isolated from each other. Alternate embodiments of the braze preform
     16 are conceived where the tabs 30 are removed and only a "braze washer"
     of material remains. Yet another embodiment of the braze preform 16 is a
     sheet of braze material that contains holes that accept the electrodes 4
     in alignment with substrate feedthrough holes 20. The metal braze
     material may be, without limitation, an alloy, a composite, or a layered
     laminate that forms the desired thermally processed structure and is
     preferably comprised of nickel or an alloy of nickel, as disclosed in
     U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,350, which is incorporated by reference in its
     entirety. Also, U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/697,149; 10/793,457,
     and 10/793,006, all of which are incorporated by reference in their
     entirety, disclose candidate braze materials.
<BR><BR>[0049]  The cross-sectional view of electrode 4 presented in FIG. 7
     presents the shaft 22 in relation to the brazing head 24, which abuts
     substrate 14 and is attached thereto by braze material at a braze joint
     74. The braze joint 74 continues along the interface formed between
     electrode feedthrough 26 and feedthrough hole 20. The proximal end of the
     electrode 4 comprises a contact surface 27 for connection to other
     electrical circuits. The electrode 4 is covered by electrically
     insulating coating 70 thereby preventing electrical contact with the
     tissue in which the electrode 4 is placed, except at the electrically
     conductive reveal 72, which in a preferred embodiment is presented as an
     uncoated band that circumscribes shaft 22. More than one reveal 72 may
     placed on a given electrode 4 to enable monitoring several neural fibers,
     for example. Each fiber will have its own individual signal, which may be
     monitored individually by selecting the signal and utilizing electronic
     filtering to distinguish the several signals from each other. It is
     conceived that the distal tip 80 (FIG. 5) may be revealed also. The
     utilization of multiple reveals is most useful when electrical signals
     are being sensed, since in a stimulation mode, each reveal would
     stimulate each contact point simultaneously, while in the detection mode,
     the electronic package can discriminate between individual sensed inputs
     on a single electrode 4 having multiple reveals 72 or holes 76.
<BR><BR>[0050]  Coating 70 is comprised of a biocompatible and electrically
     insulating coating, such as parylene, polyimide, alumina, or zirconia.
     Coating 70 is preferably comprised of parylene, a well known organic
     coating that is biocompatible. Electrically conductive contact between
     tissue and electrode 4 is limited by the position, size, and shape of the
     reveal 72.
<BR><BR>[0051]  An alternative embodiment of the electrode 4 is presented in FIG.
     8, wherein the electrode 4 is coated with insulating coating 70 except at
     through-hole 76, which in this embodiment passes completely through the
     shaft 22. The inside of hole 76 is left uncoated, where electrically
     conductive contact with the tissue occurs.
<BR><BR>[0052]  A further feature of the embodiment presented in FIG. 8 is that
     the living tissue, which may be a nerve bundle or an axon, grows into the
     hole 76 and thereby anchors the electrode in position in the tissue. Hole
     76 need not pass completely through shaft 22 to provide an anchor for the
     ingrowth of tissue. The hole 76 has a diameter of about 0.01 to 0.03 mm
     (0.0005 to 0.001 inches) and may be fabricated by laser drilling.
<BR><BR>[0053]  Another alternative embodiment is presented in FIG. 9, where the
     hole 76 is electrically insulated and coated along its inside walls with
     coating 78, which is preferably the same coating as the coating 70 on the
     outside of electrode 4. In this embodiment the hole 76 provides an anchor
     to the living tissue. The reveal 72 provides electrical communication
     with the tissue.
<BR><BR>[0054]  A further embodiment of an electrode array 100 is presented in
     FIG. 10 wherein the electrodes 106, which are bonded to oval substrate
     112, have variable lengths. The substrate 112 and electrode array 100
     pattern may be oval, circular, rectangular, or an irregular shape without
     limitation. The reveals, not illustrated, may be located in one plane, at
     variable locations, or in a non-repeating pattern.
<BR><BR>[0055]  The embodiment presented in FIG. 11 presents electrode array 102
     wherein the electrodes 108 are of equal length but each has a reveal 116
     that is disposed at various locations along the length of electrode 108
     such that contact with the living tissue occurs with different tissue
     bundles, for example. While not illustrated, it is envisioned by the
     inventors that the spacing between electrodes 108 may be variable and
     need not be equidistant from each other.
<BR><BR>[0056]  The embodiment of FIG. 12 presents an electrode array 104 wherein
     the electrodes 110, which are bonded to non-flat, irregular substrate
     114, have irregular lengths. The reveals, not illustrated, may be
     arranged in a multitude of arrangements, as described for FIG. 11.
<BR><BR>[0057]  The alternative embodiment of FIG. 13 presents the electrode 4
     inserted through the substrate 14 from the bottom surface 126. The
     contact surface 122 of terminal 120 provides a connecting surface to the
     other electrical circuits. In this configuration, FIG. 13, the braze
     surface 74 is concealed from the living tissue environment.
<BR><BR>[0058]  FIG. 14 presents an embodiment that is similar to that of FIG. 13,
     except that presenting contact surface 120 is on brazing head 24, which
     results in a more readily formed electrode 4.
<BR><BR>[0059]  FIG. 15 is more readily formed that the electrode of FIG. 13 or 14
     and contact surface 122 is formed on shaft 22.
<BR><BR>[0060]  The substrate 14, FIG. 16, contains a number of feedthrough holes
     20 which correspond to the number and configuration of electrodes 4 when
     they are arranged in the electrode array 6. The electrode 4 then
     terminates with feedthrough 26 which, in the embodiment presented in FIG.
     16, enters feedthrough hole 20 from the bottom surface 126 of substrate
     14 until brazing head 24 contacts braze preform 16, which in turn
     contacts substrate 14.
<BR><BR>[0061]  Although the invention has been described and illustrated in
     detail, it is to be clearly understood that the same is by way of
     illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of
     limitation, the spirit and scope of this invention being limited only by
     the terms of the appended claims.
